After 10 years working as a IT engineer managing and setting up servers and databases, packaging applications as well as building software to help with my day to day work. I decided to do something I have always been passionate about and so joined the intensive software developer course at Makers Academy so that I can craft beautiful code for a living full time.

A junior developer with a entrepreneurial spirit to craft great applications that make a real difference. Enjoy learning new skills, passionate about the web and want to put my mark on the industry.

## <a name="traits">Traits</a>
I have asked members of my team whom I have worked with for feedback on some of my strengths. Below is a non exhaustive list of traits that stood out to me:

#### Perseverance in resolving problems
A never give up attitude to resolving problems. Have spent the last two years building [JobVeta.co.uk]. I faced many problems on the way but always found a solution or workaround. Self driven and put the work in to make great products.

#### Visionary
Can visualize an application while it's still on the drawing board.

#### Fast learner
Quickly able to pick up new technologies. For example for the final project at Makers Academy me and my team built two clients one of which was using Swift for the iOS application. This was completely new to all of the team and in less then 2 weeks built a working MVP.
